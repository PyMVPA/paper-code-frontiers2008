Current directory contains the code snippets for the data analysis for
this paper.

Conventions:

You might have synced the data from belka to your local box somewhere
else than frontiers/data, thus please create a symlink. Code snippets
should assume that data is under frontiers/data.

Update: Please use the config handler to get value of MVPA_PATHS_DATA_ROOT
instead of hardcoded paths!
